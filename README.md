## About
Given an .csv file with the following data:
- Date
- Time
- Source IP
- Source Port
- Source Hostname
- Destination IP
- Destination Port
- Destination Hostname
Using our Data Structures & Algorithms knowledge, we will be solving the following...

### Objectives:
- Create the ADT of the object where each line of the log will be saved.
- Implement the ADT in a class.
- Read the file given by your teacher, where you create a vector of the class you generated and save all the data.
- Implement the comparators for the ordering and search methods that you consider necessary to answer the questions.
- Justify your selection of sort and search methods.
- Submit a report with the resolved questions, the ADT. Also, deliver the / the cpp made. Clearly indicate individual contributions to work on the report. Deliveries where it is said that all the members did everything will not be valid.

### Questions:
- How many records does your file have?
- How many records are there from the second recorded day? What day is this?
- Do any of the computers belong to Jeffrey, Betty, Katherine, Scott, Benjamin, Samuel, or Raymond?
- What is the address of the company's internal network?
- Is some computer called server.reto.com?
- What mail service do you use (some ideas: Gmail, Hotmail, Outlook, Protonmail)?
- Considering only the destination ports, which ports below 1000 are being used? List the ports and investigate which application / service generally uses them.
